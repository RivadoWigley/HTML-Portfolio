<h1>THE BEST SERIES OF ALL TIME ACCORDING TO MARK</h1>
<h2>TOP THREE SERIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Sopranos</h3>
<p>When The Sopranos was first released no one really new the impact this series would have on television.
   If you want to see what helped inspire all modern television series then watch this.</p>

<h3>Mindhunter</h3>
<p>One thing I really dislike about Netflix is when they cancel a series without warning.
   At least with Mindhunter you can watch the two seasons that exist and know that most of the story lines reach a satisfactory conclusion.
   Based on the FBI's elite serial crime unit, the series provides an insight into the minds of people you would probably never want to meet.</p>

<h3>Father Ted</h3>
<p>After mentioning two fantastic crimes series, I think it's time for something completely different.
   Set on a fictional Island off the coast of Ireland, this sitcom is about three exiled priests. It pokes fun at the Catholic church,
 whilst making some serious points.</p>
