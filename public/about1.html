<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>My name is Mark and I am from Birmingham (England), now living in Spain with my wife and daughter.</p>

<p>I've spent many years studying law and teaching Legal English to numerous international clients. This has taught me invaluable skills, which I use on a daily basis. Such as research, analysing and problem solving techniques, a comprehensive understanding of social issues, exposure to international perspectives on a varity of topics, as well as excellent communication skills. </p>

<p>Additionally, growing up in an environment of photographers and artists has allowed and encouraged me to develope and hone creative, technical skills, as well as thinking out of the box in terms of communication.
